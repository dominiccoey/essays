# Baumol’s Cost Disease, AI & Economic Growth

This page uses **Tufte-Jekyll** and renders math via **MathJax**.

Inline math \(x^2 + y^2 = z^2\) and display math:

$$
e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
$$

Here is a *sidenote*{% sidenote "sn-1" "On wide screens this note appears in the left margin." %}  

You can drop in margin figures, margin notes, full-width images, etc.  
See the theme’s README for all the `{% sidenote %}`, `{% marginnote %}`, and `{% fullwidth %}` tags.
